This repository contains data published in [this paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2021.635881/full?&utm_source=Email_to_authors_&utm_medium=Email&utm_content=T1_11.5e1_author&utm_campaign=Email_publication&field=&journalName=Frontiers_in_Microbiology&id=635881). The data spans the 16S rRNA V3–V4 region (10 samples from 10 individual guts) and ITS (10 samples from 10 individual guts) region as specified in the sample metadata. All the primers used in the study: 314F-CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG and 805R-GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC for the V3–V4 region, and F5-GCATCGATGAAGAACGCAGC and R5-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC, were trimmed at the sequencing facility and thus the primer trimming step was skipped in our analysis. We truncated our reads at the lengths of 290 and 241 for the forward and reverse reads respectively, to ensure that we filtered out the low quality regions towards the ends of the sequencing run.
